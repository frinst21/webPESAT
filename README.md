# PESAT (Pelaporan Alat Rusak)

"Pesat" is a website used to report equipment that is damaged or has troubles. 
This website was created by us specifically for the BMKG Office, Sultan Hasanuddin Class 1 Meteorological Station, Makassar. It is hoped that this website can make it easier and more efficient for employees and technicians to complete their tasks.
